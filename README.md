🚘 Vehicle Rental System
📜 Introduction
The Vehicle Rental System is a Java-based application designed to provide efficient vehicle rentals and returns. Customers can rent cars, bikes, and scooters for a specified duration, process returns, and generate receipts for their transactions.
This system follows object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making it scalable, maintainable, and modular. Using a menu-driven interface, users can interact with rental services seamlessly while maintaining accurate vehicle availability records.

✨ Features
✅ Vehicle Rental and Return Management – Customers can rent available vehicles and return them after use.
📜 Automatic Receipt Generation – Rental and return receipts provide clear transaction details.
🚦 Real-time Availability Tracking – Vehicles are dynamically marked as rented or available.
👤 Customer Information Management – Each customer is uniquely identified and linked to their rental records.
🛠️ Error Handling & Validation – Prevents invalid transactions, ensuring smooth system operation.
🧩 Modular & Scalable Architecture – Designed for easy extension, supporting new vehicle types and enhancements.

🛠️ Project Structure
🚗 Vehicle (Abstract Class)
Defines common attributes and functionalities shared by all vehicles.
🏷️ Attributes:
- Unique identifier distinguishing each vehicle.
- Brand name indicating the manufacturer.
- Model name specifying the type.
- Base rental price per day defining cost.
- Boolean flag tracking availability status.
⚙️ Methods:
- calculatePrice(int rentalDays) – Computes total rental cost based on rental duration.
- rent() – Marks vehicle as unavailable upon renting.
- returnVehicle() – Restores availability when returned.
- getType() – Abstract method for subclasses to define vehicle type.
- Getter methods – Retrieve brand, model, rental price, and availability status.
🚘 Car, 🏍️ Bike, 🛵 Scooty (Subclasses of Vehicle)
Each subclass inherits from Vehicle and implements getType() to return its specific type.
🚘 Car Class
Represents four-wheeled vehicles designed for comfortable passenger transport.
- Large size, supporting multiple passengers.
- Higher rental cost, ideal for long-distance travel.
- getType() returns "Car".
🏍️ Bike Class
Represents two-wheeled motorized vehicles, often used by individual riders.
- Compact and lightweight, designed for speed.
- Moderate rental price, positioned between cars and scooters.
- getType() returns "Bike".
🛵 Scooty Class
Represents lightweight, easy-to-ride vehicles, perfect for urban commuting.
- Budget-friendly rental cost.
- Ideal for short-distance travel.
- getType() returns "Scooty".

👤 Customer Class
Stores customer details and maintains accurate rental records.
🏷️ Attributes:
- Unique identifier assigned to each customer.
- Customer name linked to rental records.
⚙️ Methods:
- getCustomerId() – Retrieves customer ID.
- getName() – Retrieves customer name.

📜 Rental Class
Handles vehicle rental transactions, linking customers to their rented vehicles.
🏷️ Attributes:
- Vehicle object referring to the rented vehicle.
- Customer object associated with the rental.
- Rental duration specifying the number of days.
⚙️ Methods:
- generateReceipt() – Generates a detailed rental receipt with transaction details.
- Getter methods – Retrieve vehicle, customer, and rental period.

🔄 Return Class
Manages the vehicle return process, updating availability and generating confirmation receipts.
🏷️ Attributes:
- Rental object referring to the returning transaction.
⚙️ Methods:
- processReturn() – Marks vehicle as available after verification.
- generateReturnReceipt() – Generates return confirmation, listing payment details.

⚙️ VehicleRentalSystem Class
Acts as the central manager for rental transactions and system operations.
🏷️ Attributes:
- List of available vehicles in inventory.
- List of registered customers stored in the system.
- List of active rentals maintaining transaction records.
⚙️ Methods:
- addVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) – Registers new vehicles in the system.
- addCustomer(Customer customer) – Adds customers during rental transactions.
- rentVehicle(Vehicle vehicle, Customer customer, int days) –
- Verifies availability before renting.
- Marks vehicle as rented and generates a receipt.
- returnVehicle(String vehicleId) –
- Searches rental records for vehicle identifier.
- Processes the return, restoring availability.
- Generates a return receipt confirming transaction.
- menu() – Offers an interactive menu-driven system for user transactions.

🚀 VehicleRentalApp Class
The entry point of the system.
⚙️ Methods:
- main() – Initializes the VehicleRentalSystem and registers predefined vehicles.
- Launches menu-driven system, allowing user interaction.
